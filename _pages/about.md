Hi! I am Yanghao Wang (王洋昊), a Ph.D. student in Ultra Large Scale Integration at [the School of Integrated Circuits](https://www.ime.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. My research is focused on neuromorphic computing and nonlinear dynamics. Now I'm in [Yuchao Yang's Group](http://yuchaolab.cn/). I obtained my B.S. also from the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University and got the 2020 IEEE Electron Devices Society Undergraduate Student Fellowship.

I am broadly interested in research that utilizes memristive devices' dynamics for exploring new computing paradigms. My research ranges from purely theoretical problems in nonlinear dynamics in neural science or chaotic circuits to close collaboration with experimentalists in order to construct hardware system with novel computing principle. Currently my research focus on two interesting themes:

+ Use Mott devices based on VO2 for constructing complex systems with its intrinsic physics dynamics, like oscillation, local activity and chaos.
+ Use computational neuroscience theory to simulate the advanced brain-inspired algorithms based on devices' characteristics and explore the neuromorphic computing paradigms with novel hardwares.

My past research is documented under the [Publications](wangyanghao.github.io) tab.

Please feel free to contact me through email if you are interested in collaborating or simply having a chat about computing!
