Hi! I am Yanghao Wang (王洋昊), a Ph.D. student in Ultra Large Scale Integration at [the School of Integrated Circuits](https://www.ime.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. My research is focused on neuromorphic computing and nonlinear dynamics. Now I'm in [Yuchao Yang's Group](http://yuchaolab.cn/). I obtained my B.S. also from the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University and got the 2020 IEEE Electron Devices Society Undergraduate Student Fellowship.

I am broadly interested in research that utilizes memristive devices' dynamics for exploring new computing paradigms, especially about ["complex computing"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-022-00434-z). My research ranges from purely theoretical problems about nonlinear dynamics in neuroscience and circuits to tentative practice for constructing a hardware system with novel computing principles. Currently my research interests focus on two themes:

+ Use Mott devices based on VO2 for constructing complex systems with its intrinsic physics dynamics, like negative differential resistance, oscillation and chaos.
+ Use computational neuroscience theory to simulate the advanced brain-inspired algorithms based on devices' characteristics and explore the neuromorphic computing paradigms with novel hardwares.

My past research is documented under the [Publications](https://3yanghaow.github.io/publications) tab.

Please feel free to contact me through e-mail if you are interested in collaborating or simply having a chat about computing and future!
